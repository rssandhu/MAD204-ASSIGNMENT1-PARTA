## Project Description  
This Java console application implements a mini People Management System demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows for managing different types of people—Students, Professors, and Teaching Assistants—with distinct properties and behaviors, using inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.

Key features include:  
- Abstract base class `Person` and its subclasses (`Student`, `Professor`, `TeachingAssistant`) implementing an interface `Evaluable` for performance evaluation.  
- Recursive methods for factorial calculation and countdown demonstration.  
- Robust menu-driven user interface via the console for adding, listing, searching (with method overloading), removing, and updating persons.  
- Exception handling and input validation to ensure data integrity.  
- Data persistence through file I/O to save and load the person list (`people.txt`).  
- Complete documentation with file headers, class/method Javadoc, and inline comments for clarity and maintainability.

## Features  
- Add new Students, Professors, or Teaching Assistants with validated input.  
- List all people with detailed properties.  
- Search by ID or name using overloaded methods.  
- Remove a person by their ID.  
- Celebrate a person’s birthday by incrementing age.  
- Evaluate performance according to custom logic per person type.  
- Demonstrate recursion with factorial and countdown examples.  
- Save and load data from a file to retain information between sessions.
